- [x] 8) Kth Largest Element in an Array — https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/

- [x] 9) Search example (implement functions)
  - Definition: Given the list of values and a search_key, implement two Python functions and test them on the example.
  - values = [10, 15, 40, 50, 67, 70, 83, 90]
  - search_key = 83
  - Tasks:
    - [x] Implement linear_search(values, key): perform a linear scan and return the index or -1.
    - [x] Implement binary_search(values, key): perform an iterative binary search on sorted (ascending) values and return the index or -1.
    - [x] Show example outputs for both functions on the provided values (expected index: 6).
    - [x] State the time complexity (big-O) for each implementation.
