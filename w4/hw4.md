## Live Coding Interview Examples and Assignment

## Example Live Interviews

!! These videos are optional to watch but recommended to complete your homework below.

### Video Examples
1. **Google Coding Interview Example**
   - Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsbtAsnJN20
   - Easy level problem solved: [Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/)
   - Note: The medium problem is optional (not included in our midterm). In interviews, we typically see two tasks: either (easy-medium) or (easy-hard) pairs to better assess candidates.

2. **Google Coding Interview With A College Student**
   - Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q_oYDQ2whs
   - This coding interview demonstrates pair programming where the candidate and interviewer discuss the problem together and complete the task while explaining their approach. They use Google Docs for interactive writing - there is no IDE, script execution, or unit testing.

3. **Beginner Training Set Turkish Playlist**
(This playlist is for Turkish students only we already publish enough examples for English those are suplementary for Turkish)
